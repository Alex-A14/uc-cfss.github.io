## To do for Wednesday

* Register your GitHub account for the class [**ADD GOOGLE LINK**] - all remaining homework assignments will be in **private repositories**. Private repos can only be seen and edited by members of our [course organization](https://github.com/uc-cfss). Once you register your GitHub account, I will invite you to join the course organization. If you don't register your account, you won't have access to any of the homework assignments.
* [Submit homework 1](hw01_edit-README.html)
* Start thinking about your topic for your [final project](project_description.html). If you want to do a group project, start identifying project partners or post on the [discussion board](https://github.com/uc-cfss/Discussion) to find classmates with similar interests.
