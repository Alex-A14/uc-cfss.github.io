# Bugs

![Not the kind of bugs we're looking for](images/bugs.jpg)

A **software bug** is "an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways."^[Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug)] In an ideal world, the computer will warn you when it encounters a bug. R has the ability to do this in some situations (see our discussion below of errors, warnings, and messages). However bugs also arise because you expect it to do one thing but provide it the ability to perform different from expectations. As I have repeatedly emphasized in class, **computers are powerful tools that are incredibly stupid**. They will do exactly what you tell them to, nothing more and nothing less. If you write your code in a way that allows it to behave in an unintended way, this is your fault. The first goal of debugging should be to prevent unintended behaviors before they strike. However, when such bugs occur we need the tools and knowledge to track down these unintended behaviors and correct them in our code.

# Defensive programming

The most important step to debugging is to prevent bugs in the first place. There are several methods we can employ to do that. Some of them are simple such as styling our code so that we follow consistent practices when writing scripts and programs. Consistency will prevent silly and minor mistakes such as typos. Good styles also make our code more **readable** for the human eye and allow us to isolate and detect errors merely by looking at the screen. Others are more advanced and focus on the concept of **failing fast** - as soon as something goes wrong, stop executing the program and announce an error.

## Writing code

Think back to [the analogy of programming languages to human languages](http://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup00.html#introduction). Programming languages adhere to a specific grammar and syntax, they contain a vocabulary, etymology, cultural conventions, word roots (prefixes and suffixes), just like English or any other written or spoken language. We can therefore equate different components of a program to their language counterparts:

Programming |	Language
------------|----------
Scripts |	Essays
Sections | Paragraphs
Lines Breaks | Sentences
Parentheses |	Punctuation
Functions |	Verbs
Variables |	Nouns

Now think about how you write a document in English. The United States just recently commemorated the 30th anniversary of [the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster), when seven crew members were tragically killed just 73 seconds after takeoff. Their deaths were seen live by millions of American schoolchildren watching around the country. A few hours after the tragedy, President Ronald Reagan gave a national address. Here is an excerpt of that address:

> weve grown used to wonders in this century its hard to dazzle us but for 25 years the united states space program has been doing just that weve grown used to the idea of space and perhaps we forget that weve only just begun were still pioneers they the members of the Challenger crew were pioneers and i want to say something to the school children of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttles takeoff i know it is hard to understand but sometimes painful things like this happen its all part of the process of exploration and discovery its all part of taking a chance and expanding mans horizons the future doesnt belong to the fainthearted it belongs to the brave the challenger crew was pulling us into the future and well continue to follow them the crew of the space shuttle challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives we will never forget them nor the last time we saw them this morning as they prepared for the journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of god

Wait a minute, this doesn't look right. What happened to the punctuation? The capitalization? Where are all the sentences and paragraph breaks? Isn't this hard to read and understand? Do you feel any of the emotions of the moment? Probably not, because the normal rules of grammar and syntax have been destroyed. Here's the same excerpt, but properly styled:

> We've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for 25 years the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.

> And I want to say something to the school children of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them....

> The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honoured us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for the journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of earth' to 'touch the face of God.'

That makes much more sense. Adhering to standard rules of style make the text more legible and interpretable. This is what we should aim for when writing programs in R.^[And for that matter, in any other programming language as well. Note however that these style rules are specific to R; other languages by necessity may use different rules and conventions.]

## Style guide

Here are some common rules you should adopt when writing code in R, adapted from Hadley Wickham's [style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).

### Notation and naming

#### File names

Files should have intuitive and meaningful names. Avoid spaces or non-standard characters in your file names. R scripts should always end in `.R`; R Markdown documents should always end in `.Rmd`.

```r
# Good
fit-models.R
utility-functions.R
gun-deaths.Rmd

# Bad
foo.r
stuff.r
gun deaths.rmd
```

#### Object names

Variables refer to data objects such as vectors, lists, or data frames. Variable and function names should be lowercase. Use an underscore (`_`) to separate words within a name. Avoid using periods (`.`). Variable names should generally be nouns and function names should be verbs. Try to pick names that are concise and meaningful.

```r
# Good
day_one
day_1

# Bad
first_day_of_the_month
DayOne
dayone
djm1
```

Where possible, avoid using names of existing functions and variables. Doing so will cause confusion for the readers of your code, not to mention make it difficult to access the existing functions and variables.

```r
# Bad
T <- FALSE
c <- 10
```

For instance, what would happen if I created a new `mean()` function?

```{r mean}
x <- 1:10
mean(x)
```

```r
# create new mean function
mean <- function(x) sum(x)
mean(x)
```

```
[1] 55
```

![](http://i.giphy.com/BxWTWalKTUAdq.gif)

### Syntax

#### Spacing

Place spaces around all [infix](https://www.programiz.com/r-programming/infix-operator) operators (=, +, -, <-, etc.). The same rule applies when using `=` in function calls.

> Always put a space after a comma, and never before (just like in regular English).

```r
# Good
average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

# Bad
average<-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
```

Place a space before left parentheses, except in a function call.

> Note: I'm terrible at remembering to do this for `if-else` or `for` loops. I typically never place a space before left parentheses, but it is supposed to be good practice. Just remember to be consistent whatever approach you choose.

```r
# Good
if (debug) do(x)
plot(x, y)

# Bad
if(debug)do(x)
plot (x, y)
```

Do not place spaces around code in parentheses or square brackets (unless thereâ€™s a comma, in which case see above).

```r
# Good
if (debug) do(x)
diamonds[5, ]

# Bad
if ( debug ) do(x)  # No spaces around debug
x[1,]   # Needs a space after the comma
x[1 ,]  # Space goes after comma not before
```

#### Curly braces

An opening curly brace should never go on its own line and should always be followed by a new line. A closing curly brace should always go on its own line, unless it's followed by else.

Always indent the code inside curly braces.

```r
# Good

if (y < 0 && debug) {
  message("Y is negative")
}

if (y == 0) {
  log(x)
} else {
  y ^ x
}

# Bad

if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")

if (y == 0) {
  log(x)
} 
else {
  y ^ x
}
```

It's ok to leave very short statements on the same line:

```r
if (y < 0 && debug) message("Y is negative")
```

#### Line length

Strive to limit your code to 80 characters per line. This fits comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font. For instance, if I wanted to convert the `chief` column to an [ordered factor](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html) for building a [faceted graph](https://github.com/uc-cfss/hw03/blob/master/demo/scotus_solution.md#solution-using-facets-and-showing-whole-data-on-each-facet-getting-harder):

```r
# Good
scdbv <- mutate(scdbv,
                chief = factor(chief, levels = c("Jay", "Rutledge", "Ellsworth",
                                                 "Marshall", "Taney", "Chase",
                                                 "Waite", "Fuller", "White",
                                                 "Taft", "Hughes", "Stone",
                                                 "Vinson", "Warren", "Burger",
                                                 "Rehnquist", "Roberts")))

# Bad
scdbv <- mutate(scdbv, chief = factor(chief, levels = c("Jay", "Rutledge", "Ellsworth", "Marshall", "Taney", "Chase", "Waite", "Fuller", "White", "Taft", "Hughes", "Stone", "Vinson", "Warren", "Burger", "Rehnquist", "Roberts")))
```

#### Indentation

When indenting your code, use two spaces. Never use tabs or mix tabs and spaces.

> By default, RStudio automatically converts tabs to two spaces in your code. So if you use the tab button in R Studio, you're good to go.

!["Insert spaces for tab" setting in RStudio](images/tab_indent.png)

The only exception is if a function definition runs over multiple lines. In that case, indent the second line to where the definition starts:

```r
# pure function
long_function_name <- function(a = "a long argument", 
                               b = "another argument",
                               c = "another long argument") {
  # As usual code is indented by two spaces.
}

# in a mutate() function
scdbv <- scdbv %>%
  mutate(majority = majority - 1,
         chief = factor(chief, levels = c("Jay", "Rutledge", "Ellsworth",
                                          "Marshall", "Taney", "Chase",
                                          "Waite", "Fuller", "White",
                                          "Taft", "Hughes", "Stone",
                                          "Vinson", "Warren", "Burger",
                                          "Rehnquist", "Roberts")))
```

#### Assignment

Use `<-`, not `=`, for assignment. Why? Because I said so. [Or read more here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1742550).

```r
# Good
x <- 5
# Bad
x = 5
```

### Comments

Comment your code. Each line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol and a single space: `#`. Comments should explain the why, not the what.

To take advantage of RStudio's [code folding feature](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200484568-Code-Folding-and-Sections), add at least four trailing dashes (-), equal signs (=), or pound signs (#) after the comment text

```r
# Section One ---------------------------------
 
# Section Two =================================
 
### Section Three #############################
```

## Auto-formatting in RStudio

There are two built-in methods of using RStudio to automatically format and clean up your code. They are not perfect, but can help in some circumstances.

### Format code

**Code > Reformat Code** (Shift + Cmd/Ctrl + A)

##### Bad code

```r
# comments are retained
1+1

if(TRUE){
x=1  # inline comments
}else{
x=2;print('Oh no... ask the right bracket to go away!')}
1*3 # one space before this comment will become two!
2+2+2    # only 'single quotes' are allowed in comments

diamonds %>%
filter(color == "I") %>%
group_by(cut) %>%
summarize(price = mean(price))

lm(y~x1+x2, data=data.frame(y=rnorm(100),x1=rnorm(100),x2=rnorm(100)))  ### a linear model

1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1  ## comments after a long line
## here is a long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long comment
```

##### Better code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# comments are retained
1 + 1

if (TRUE) {
x = 1  # inline comments
} else{
x = 2
print('Oh no... ask the right bracket to go away!')
}
1 * 3 # one space before this comment will become two!
2 + 2 + 2    # only 'single quotes' are allowed in comments

diamonds %>%
filter(color == "I") %>%
group_by(cut) %>%
summarize(price = mean(price))

lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data.frame(
y = rnorm(100),
x1 = rnorm(100),
x2 = rnorm(100)
))  ### a linear model

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  ## comments after a long line
## here is a long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long comment
```

**Format code** will attempt to adjust the source code formatting to adhere to the style guide specified above. It doesn't look perfect, but is more readable than the original. We should still clean up some of this manually, such as the comment on the last line that flows over.

### Reindent lines

**Code > Reindent Lines** (Cmd/Ctrl + I)

##### Bad code

```r
# comments are retained
1 + 1

if (TRUE) {
x = 1  # inline comments
} else{
x = 2
print('Oh no... ask the right bracket to go away!')
}
1 * 3 # one space before this comment will become two!
2 + 2 + 2    # only 'single quotes' are allowed in comments

diamonds %>%
filter(color == "I") %>%
group_by(cut) %>%
summarize(price = mean(price))

lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data.frame(
y = rnorm(100),
x1 = rnorm(100),
x2 = rnorm(100)
))  ### a linear model

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  ## comments after a long line
## here is a long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long comment
```

##### Better code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# comments are retained
1 + 1

if (TRUE) {
  x = 1  # inline comments
} else{
  x = 2
  print('Oh no... ask the right bracket to go away!')
}
1 * 3 # one space before this comment will become two!
2 + 2 + 2    # only 'single quotes' are allowed in comments

diamonds %>%
  filter(color == "I") %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarize(price = mean(price))

lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data.frame(
  y = rnorm(100),
  x1 = rnorm(100),
  x2 = rnorm(100)
))  ### a linear model

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +
  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  ## comments after a long line
## here is a long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long comment
```

**Reindent lines** will add spacing to conditional expression blocks, multi-line functions, expressions which run over multiple lines, and piped operations. Again, it is not perfect but it does some of the formatting work for us.

## Exercise: style this code

Here's a chunk of code from an exercise in another class. It is formatted terribly, but as you can see it does work - the computer can interpret it. Use the style guide to clean it up and make it readable.

```{r exercise_bad}
library(tidyverse)

annual_income<-function(base_inc,p,g,sigma,n_years,start_year=2018){
errors<-rnorm(n_years,mean=0,sd=sigma)
annual_income_log<-vector("numeric",n_years)
for(year in seq_len(n_years)){if(year == 1){annual_income_log[[year]] <- log(base_inc) + errors[[year]]}
else{annual_income_log[[year]]<-(1-p)*(log(base_inc)+g*(year-1))+p*annual_income_log[[year-1]]+errors[[year]]}
}
data_frame(inc=exp(annual_income_log),year=2018+seq_len(n_years)-1)}

# Communicating problems with conditions

**Conditions** are a method for communicating to the user when something unanticipated has occurred. Helpfully, many package authors will build these into their functions to explicitly communicate with users when they attempt to use the function improperly. In fact, when you write your own functions you too can use conditions to alert users when something has gone wrong. There are three levels of conditions in R, which each lead to different outcomes.

## Types of conditions

### Fatal errors

**Fatal errors** are raised by `stop()` and force all execution to terminate. Typically errors are used to abort code or a function when it is impossible for the function to continue.

```{r error, error = TRUE}
addition <- function(x, y){
  if(!is_numeric(c(x, y))) stop("One of your inputs is not a number.")
  
  x + y
}

addition(3, "abc")
```

### Warnings

**Warnings** are generated by `warning()` and used to display potential problems. The function or code will continue to process, but the user will be notified that something undesirable has occurred. For example, the [**logit** transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit) converts a probability $p$ to the *log-odds*, or the logarithm of the odds. We can write a function to do this for us, but because probability values must be between 0 and 1, it will fail when $x$ is outside of the range $[0,1]$.

```{r logit, error = TRUE}
logit <- function(x){
  log(x / (1 - x))
}

logit(-1)
```

But the message produced is rather opaque. We could add a custom error message to stop the whole function:

```{r logit_error, error = TRUE}
logit <- function(x){
 if(x < 0 | x > 1) stop('x not between 0 and 1')
 log(x / (1 - x))
}

logit(-1)
```

But what if instead we wanted to produce an `NA` value in these situations, and just warn the user what happened? We could revise this yet again to produce a warning message:

```{r logit_warning}
logit <- function(x){
  x <- ifelse(x < 0 | x > 1, NA, x)
  if(is.na(x)) warning('x not between 0 and 1')
  log(x / (1 - x))
}

logit(-1)
```

### Messages

Messages are generated by `message()` and are used to give informative output to the user. It doesn't mean anything even went wrong, just that there is some information that might prove useful. You've seen these before in `ggplot()` when generating smoothing lines.

```{r message_ggplot}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

Did you see the message?

```
## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam'
```

This tells us that `geom_smooth()` generated the line using the `gam()` method.^[Use `?geom_smooth` to see the different methods that can be used.] Nothing went wrong, there was no unexpected behavior, that is just the default smoothing method for a dataset of this size. But it is helpful because what if you wanted to use a linear smoothing function instead? Now you know it was not the default method, and if you want to use it you need to explicitly set it.

```{r message_ggplot_override}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

The nice thing about messages is that they can be suppressed using the `suppressMessages()` function. This way if your function produces dozens or hundreds of messages, you can block them from being printed. A nice feature if you are knitting an R Markdown document. If you were to include messages simply by using the `print()` function, they could not be ignored.

```{r message_print}
demo_message <- function() message("This is a message")
demo_message()
suppressMessages(demo_message())  # no output

demo_print <- function() print("This is a message")
demo_print()
suppressMessages(demo_print())  # still output
```

## Exercise: build a function with conditions

This is a basic function that calculates the square root of the sum of two numbers.

```{r sqrt}
sqrt_sum <- function(x, y){
  sqrt(sum(x, y))
}

sqrt_sum(3, 6)
```

However, look at what happens when the sum of the numbers is negative.

```{r}
sqrt_sum(3, -6)
```

We get a cryptic error message. What happened? **You cannot take the square root of a negative number.** Let's rewrite the function to be explicit with this.

1. Rewrite `sqrt_sum()` to produce a fatal error any time the sum of the two numbers is negative.

    ```{r exercise_error, error = TRUE}
    sqrt_sum <- function(x, y){

      sqrt(x + y)
    }
    
    sqrt_sum(3, -6)
    ```
    
      </p>
    </details>

1. Rewrite `sqrt_sum()` to return a missing value (`NA`) any time the sum of the two numbers is negative and produce a warning message explaining why this happened.

        warning("The sum of these numbers is negative.")
        return(NA)
      }
      sqrt(x + y)
    }
    
    sqrt_sum(3,-6)
    ```

# Tracking down bugs using `traceback()`

Hadley writes a [detailed breakdown of all the debugging tools available in RStudio](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Exceptions-Debugging.html#debugging-tools). Here I want to focus on one specific tool, the **traceback**.

## The call stack

The **call stack** is the sequence of calls that lead up to an error. Remember that when you execute a function in R, that function relies on additional functions to complete your task. In order to determine which function generated the bug, we need to "trace back" through the call stack to find the problematic function.

Here's a trivial example from *Advanced R*. Note the sequence of functions:

* `f()` calls `g()`
* `g()` calls `h()`
* `h()` calls `i()`
* `i()` adds together a number and a string, creating an error

```{r callstack, error = TRUE}
f <- function(a) g(a)
g <- function(b) h(b)
h <- function(c) i(c)
i <- function(d) "a" + d
f(10)
```

Clearly the error is not generated by `f()`, yet at first glance all we know is that by executing `f()` we have generated an error. How could we view the call stack to determine the sequence of functions leading up to the error? Use `traceback()`:

```{r traceback, eval = FALSE}
traceback()
```

```
# 4: i(c) at exceptions-example.R#3
# 3: h(b) at exceptions-example.R#2
# 2: g(a) at exceptions-example.R#1
# 1: f(10)
```

We read the call stack from bottom to top. The first call was `f(10)`, which calls `g()`, which calls `h()`, which calls `i()`, which triggers the error. If the code is saved in a file, R will also print the location where the function is saved using the format `filename.R#linenumber`.

# Condition handling

Unexpected errors should be hunted down and destroyed. Well, maybe they just require interactive debugging to figure out what went wrong so you can revise the code to avoid the error. However in other instances you may have **expected errors**, or errors that don't require interactive debugging, but instead just require automatic handling. This commonly occurs when you are fitting many statistical models to data sets, or iterating over a list or the columns of a data frame. In these situations you don't want the entire iteration to fail because of a single element; instead, you want to complete the entire operation and then examine errors after the fact. There are three methods for condition handling I want to demonstrate and practice in this lesson:

* `try()` allows you to continue execution even if a fatal error occurs
* `safely()` is an **adverb** that modifies functions to never throw an error; instead, any output, messages, warnings, and errors are captured as enhanced output.

## Ignore errors with `try()`

`try()` allows a function to continue execution even after a fatal error occurs. Recall that under normal circumstances, a fatal error immediately terminates a function and prevents the function from returning a value:

```{r try_error, error = TRUE}
f1 <- function(x) {
  log(x)
  10
}
f1("x")
```

If we wrap the statement that generates the error in `try()`, the error will be signalled, but execution of the function will continue.

```{r try_error_wrap, error = TRUE}
f2 <- function(x) {
  try(log(x))
  10
}
f2("a")
```

To pass larger blocks of code, wrap them in `{}`:

```r
try({
  a <- 1
  b <- "x"
  a + b
})
```

## Dealing with failure using `safely()`

`try()` is part of base R and like its cousins `tryCatch()` and `withCallingHandlers()` has existed for years now. If you begin to write and develop your own functions on a regular basis you should familiarize yourself with and practice these condition handling methods. However I presume the vast majority of you, at least for the immediate future, will more likely rely on existing functions. When you encounter errors in these situations, you are not going to rewrite functions from packages like `dplyr` or `ggplot2`. Instead, you want a method of dealing with failure that doesn't bring your code to a crashing halt.

Enter the `safely()` function. This function is an **adverb** in that it takes a function (a verb in `tidyverse` speak) and returns a modified version. The modified version never throws an error, but instead returns a list with two elements:

1. `result` is the original result. If there was an error, then this will be `NULL`.
1. `error` is an error object. If the operation was successful, then this will be `NULL`.

This is quite similar to `try()`, but the result is more predictable. Let's look at a basic function like `sqrt()`:

```{r sqrt_safely}
safe_sqrt <- safely(sqrt)
str(safe_sqrt(9))
str(safe_sqrt("a"))
```

When the function succeeds, the `result` element contains the expected result and `error` is empty (more formally, is `NULL`). When the function fails, the `result` element is `NULL` and the error element contains the error object.

The benefit of `safely()` quickly becomes apparent when used in conjunction with `map()`.

```{r safely_map, error = TRUE}
x <- list("a", 4, 5)

# unsafely square root
y <- x
  map(sqrt)

# safely log
y <- x %>%
  map(safely(sqrt))
str(y)
```

The beauty is that the result of `map()` and `safely()` is entirely predictable. It will always contain the same number of elements as the original data object (in this case a list), and each element will be another list of two elements: the `result` and the `error`.

However a different structure could be more useful to work with: two lists, one with all the errors and one with all the results. To obtain that, we just use `transpose()`:

```{r transpose}
y <- y %>%
  transpose()
str(y)
```

To extract the values of `x` where `y` is an error:

```{r error_x}
is_ok <- y$error %>%
  map_lgl(is_null)
x[!is_ok]
```

To extract the values of `y` that are ok:

```{r okay_y}
y$result[is_ok] %>%
  flatten_dbl()
```

`safely()` comes from the `purrr` package (hence why it plays so nicely with `map()`). `purr` also provides two related adverbs for condition handling:

* `possibly()` always returns a result, but the difference is that you specify a default value to return if an error occurs:

    ```{r possibly}
    x %>%
      map_dbl(possibly(sqrt, NA))
    ```

* `quietly()` captures not only errors, but printed output, messages, and warnings as well:

    ```{r quietly}
    x <- list(1, -1)
    x %>%
      map(quietly(sqrt)) %>%
      str()
    ```

## Exercise: handle conditions using `safely()`

1. Write an iterative operation that safely calculates the maximum value for every column in `rcfss::gun_deaths`.

      <p>

    ```{r gun_deaths_safely}
    library(rcfss)
    
    # for loop
    output <- vector("list", ncol(gun_deaths))
    safe_max <- safely(max) # cannot pass na.rm parameter here
    
    for(i in seq_along(gun_deaths)){
      output[[i]] <- safe_max(gun_deaths[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)
    }
    
    str(output)
    
    # map
    gun_deaths %>%
      map(safe_max, na.rm = TRUE)
    ```

1. Perform the same operation as above, but this time replace error messages with a missing value (`NA`).

    ```{r gun_deaths_possibly}
    # for loop
    output <- vector("list", ncol(gun_deaths))
    possible_max <- possibly(max, NA)
    
    for(i in seq_along(gun_deaths)){
      output[[i]] <- possible_max(gun_deaths[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)
    }
    
    str(output)
    
    # map
    gun_deaths %>%
      map(possible_max, na.rm = TRUE)
    
    ## same thing without predefining the adverb
    gun_deaths %>%
      map(possibly(max, NA), na.rm = TRUE)
    ```    
      </p>
