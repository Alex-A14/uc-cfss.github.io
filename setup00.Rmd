# Introduction

This course teaches students how to think programatically and use computational approaches to explore and address social scientific questions. Much of computer programming involves translating what you wish to do into a set of computational instructions. Think of human languages: languages conform to specific sets of grammatical and syntax rules which define how to interpret elements of speech such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Some languages have simple rules and are (relatively) easy to learn; others follow more complex rules that require greater effort in order to gain fluency.^[[Language Difficulty Rankings](http://www.effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty)] Some languages derive from a common source and therefore share many similarities that make it easier to learn a second language within the same family of languages. So a native Spanish speaker will find it easier to learn French rather than Chinese, because French and Spanish share many grammatical rules and root derivations of words whereas Chinese and Spanish do not. Regardless, these are all perfectly usable languages humans use to communicate with one another.

In this course, we will learn how to use two specific languages to write programs and conduct data analysis: [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

## Strengths of Python and R

### Open-source

First, using these languages is *completely free*. Second, open-source software is developed *collaboratively*, meaning the source code is open to public inspection, modification, and improvement.

### Popular
Python and R are widely used in the physical and social sciences, [as well as in government, non-profits, and the private sector](http://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2015).

### Well supported

Many developers and social scientists write programs in Python and R. As a result, there is also a large support community available to help troubleshoot problematic code. As seen in the Redmonk programming language rankings (which compare languages' appearances on Github [usage] and StackOverflow [support]), both Python and R appear near the top of both rankings.

## Drawbacks of Python and R

### Lack of point-and-click interface

Python and R, like any computing language, rely on programmatic execution of functions. That is, to do anything you must write code. This differs from popular statistical software such as [Stata](http://www.stata.com/) or [SPSS](http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spss/) which at their core utilize a command language but overlay them with drop-down menus that enable a point-and-click interface. While much easier to operate, there are several downsides to this approach - mainly that it [makes it impossible to reproduce one's analysis](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf).

### Similarities and differences between Python and R

By this I simply mean that like with human languages, they share important commonalities and differences. For instance, one commmon task in the social sciences is to estimate the parameters of an [ordinary least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares) regression model.^[Example drawn from [RosettaCode.org](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Multiple_regression)] Using the base software distributions, in R you could do this using the following code:

```{r rdemo}
x <- c(1.47, 1.50, 1.52, 1.55, 1.57, 1.60, 1.63, 1.65, 1.68, 1.70, 1.73, 1.75, 1.78, 1.80, 1.83)
y <- c(52.21, 53.12, 54.48, 55.84, 57.20, 58.57, 59.93, 61.29, 63.11, 64.47, 66.28, 68.10, 69.92, 72.19, 74.46)
 
lm(y ~ x)
```

In Python, you can perform a similar operation using the `numpy` library.

```{r pythondemo, engine='python'}
import numpy
 
height = [1.47, 1.50, 1.52, 1.55, 1.57, 1.60, 1.63, 1.65, 1.68, 1.70, 1.73, 1.75, 1.78, 1.80, 1.83]
weight = [52.21, 53.12, 54.48, 55.84, 57.20, 58.57, 59.93, 61.29, 63.11, 64.47, 66.28, 68.10, 69.92, 72.19, 74.46]
 
X = numpy.array(height)[:, None]**range(2)
y = weight
 
print(numpy.linalg.lstsq(X, y)[0])
```

Note that both languages provide the same result, but the code used to generate that result varies slightly. The Python code does not look as intuitive as the R code, but it still gets the job done. Which brings us to the main point about Python and R.

### Which is right for the job?

Python and R each have their own strengths and weaknesses which make them better suited to different tasks.

* Things R does well
    * Statistical analysis - R was written by statisticians, so it is designed first and foremost as a language for statistical analysis.
    * Data visualization - while the base R `graphics` package is comprehensive and powerful, additional libraries such as [`ggplot2`](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) and [`lattice`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html) make R the go-to language for power data visualization approaches.
* Things R does not do as well
    * Speed - while by no means a slug, R is not written to be a fast, speedy language. Depending on the complexity of the task and the size of your data, you may find R taking a long time to execute your program.
* Things Python does well
    * General computation - since Python is a general computational language, it is more versatile at non-statistical tasks and is a bit more popular outside the statistics community.
    * Speed - because it is a general computing language, Python is optimized to be fast (assuming you write your code optimally). As your data becomes larger or more complex, you might find Python to be faster than R for your analytical needs.
    * The [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) - Jupyter (formerly iPython) notebooks allow you to store live code and results in one central document. This tool used to only work for Python, but is now multi-platform and supports R, Julia, and other popular languages. That said, R also includes useful tools for dynamic documents containing code and analysis such as [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and the recently released [R Markdown Notebook](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html).
    * Workflow - since Python is a general-purpose language, you can build entire applications using it. R, not so much.
* Things Python does not do as well
    * Visualizations - visual graphics libraries in Python are increasing in number and quality (see [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org/), [`pygal`](http://www.pygal.org/en/stable/), and [`seaborn`](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/)), but are still behind R in terms of comprehensiveness and ease of use. Of course, once you wish to create interactive and advanced information visualizations, you can also used more specialized software such as [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com/) or [D3](https://d3js.org/).
    * Add-on libraries - previously Python was criticized for its lack of libraries to perform statistical analysis and data manipulation, especially relative to the plethora of libraries for R. In recent years Python has begun to catch up with libraries for scientific computing ([`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/)), data analysis ([`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org/)), and machine learning ([`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)).

In this course we will start learning the basic principles of computer programming using Python, then switch over in the third week to R for data analysis and visualizations. This will expose you to both languages and the strengths/weaknesses of each.

# Python

[![](images/xkcd_python.png)](https://xkcd.com/353/)

Python was developed in the 1990s as a general-purpose programming language. It [emphasizes simplicity over complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python) in both its syntax and core functions. As a result, code written in Python is (relatively) easy to read and follow as compared to more complex languages like Perl or Java. This also means the base installation of Python is actually very minimalistic - to perform data analysis of any significance, you will almost assuredly have to use an add-on library.

## Python 2 or 3?

tl;dr - use Python 3

When software is updated, developers typically try to avoid breaking pre-existing features. So a version update from 2.2 to 2.3 typically includes minor changes which allow previously written code to (mostly) continue working correctly. Sometimes however updates are so significant and expansive that they break existing code. When this happens, developers typically signify such a transition by incrementing the base version number (i.e. instead of 2.2 -> 2.3, 2.2 -> 3.0).

[Such a transition occured for Python in 2008 when Python 2.x was replaced by Python 3.0.](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3) Support for 2.x continued until 2010 with the final release in the 2.x line (2.7). Python 3.5 is the most recent major release and is considered the active development version. However because the switch from 2 -> 3 broke many existing libraries and functions, it has taken a large amount of time for major developers and libraries to make the transition to 3.x.

In this course we will use Python 3. It is the future of Python and for our purposes does what we need it to do. At some point in the future you may encounter a problem where you need to use a library that only works on Python 2. When you reach this point, I wish you good luck and godspeed. Just kidding, the differences between Python 2 and 3 are not insurmountable, we just won't cover them in this course. You can learn more about that on your own.

## Anaconda

One approach to setting your machine up to program in Python would be the following:

1. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install.
2. Download an integrated development environment (IDE) in which to write and execute code (or just use a text editor).
3. Begin writing programs only to discover that you need to download and install a separate library using `pip`, `PyPI` or some other package manager to perform your analysis. Or worse, have to compile each library manually.
4. Go do this 50 separate times.
5. Become aggravated when libraries don't install correctly.
6. Throw your computer out the window.

An alternative is to use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), an open-source distribution of Python which includes many useful packages pre-installed, a package manager to download and install over 700 additional packages, and some additional applications built on Python, one of which we will find very useful.

### Installing Anaconda

By installing Anaconda, we also install Python if it is not already included on your computer.

1. Go [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and download Anaconda for your specific operating system. Make sure to select the version with Python 3.5.
2. Install Anaconda. I presume you've installed software on your computer before. Installing Anaconda is not any different.

## Jupyter Notebook

[Juypter (formerly iPython) Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is a popular IDE for writing and executing Python scripts. Jupyter Notebook is actually a web server (run either locally or on the internet) that runs Python, R, and other popular computer languages and combines live code with output and explanatory text to integrate your workflow. The result is a single reproducible document which contains your research and analysis. Jupyter Notebook is installed with Anaconda.

## Test it

Make sure you've installed everything correctly.

1. Run `jupyter notebook` from the command line (using Terminal in Mac/Linux or the Command Prompt in Windows). You should see some output like this:

```{r test_jupyter, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
$ jupyter notebook
[I 08:58:24.417 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /Users/benjamin
[I 08:58:24.417 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
[I 08:58:24.417 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/
[I 08:58:24.417 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
```

Most of this information is not directly relevant for our purposes, but one important thing it tells us is the URL of your local notebook server (by default, `http://localhost:8888`). Running `jupyter notebook` also automatically launches the server in your default web browser.

The *Notebook Dashboard* should open in your web browser. From here you can navigate directories and files, and create and open notebooks.

![](images/jupyter_server.png)

To make sure you've set everything up correctly, click "New" > "Notebooks (Python)".

![](images/jupyter_new_notebook.png)

You've just created a new notebook in the directory where you launched `jupyter notebook`. In the future, you can store notebooks in any directory you prefer using the Notebook Dashboard. Now, type the following code in the first cell and then press Shift + Enter.

```{r jupyter_test, engine='python', eval=FALSE}
x = 5 + 2
print(x)
```

Your window should now look like this:

![](images/jupyter_test.png)

If done correctly, you've just performed basic arithmetic, stored the result in an object, then printed the object to your screen.

To close your notebook, close the browser windows for your Jupyter Notebook and the Notebook Dashboard. Then back in the command line window, type Control-C twice to stop the Notebook server.

# R and RStudio

## R

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source programming language based on the [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)) from the 1970s. It is very popular in the physical and social sciences due to it's cost (free) and versatility. Thousands of expansion libraries have been published which extend the tasks R can perform, and users can write their own custom functions and/or libraries to perform specific operations.

### Installing R

1. Download the latest binary distribution for your operating system (e.g. Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux) from [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/), a network of servers around the world which store identical copies of the R binaries, source code, and thousands of additional libraries. The binary version has been pre-compiled and is the easiest to install. Windows users should make sure to select the binary for the *base distribution*.^[Advanced users may want to install from source, but most likely if you are an advanced user you don't need to take this course.]
2. Run the installation from the file you just downloaded (`.exe` or `.pkg`).
3. Open R. You should see a screen similar to this:

![](images/r_console.png)

This is the default R console. You can use this as your development environment where you write and execute code. However the default R console is very minimalistic and not much more useful than a text editor. This is why we will use RStudio for programming in R. However to demonstrate that your R installation works, type `5 + 2` in the console and press enter. You should see the following:

```{r testr}
5 + 2
```

Congratulations! You just programatically performed basic arithmetic.

## RStudio

As previously mentioned, the base R distribution is not the best for developing and writing programs. Instead, we want an integrated development environment (IDE) which will allow us to write and execute code, debug programs, and automate certain tasks. In this course we will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/), perhaps the most popular IDE available for R. Like R, it is open-source, expandable, and provides many useful tools and enhancements over the base R environment.

### Installing RStudio

1. Download the [latest version of RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) appropriate for your operating system.^[If you feel ambitious, you can download [the preview release](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) instead which includes the latest enhancements and bug-fixes. Preview releases are usually stable, but if you encounter errors you can always revert back to the stable release.]
2. Install it!

### Test it

To make sure you've done everything correctly, open up RStudio on your computer. You should see something that looks like this:

![](images/rstudio_startup.png)

We'll discuss this in more detail later, but the RStudio IDE is divided into 4 separate panes (one of which is hidden for now) which all serve specific functions. For now, to make sure R and RStudio are setup correctly, type `x <- 5 + 2` into the *console* pane (the one on the left side of your screen - this is equivalent to the main window you saw when you opened the base R program, where you can type and run live R code) and execute it by pressing Enter/Return. You just created an object in R called `x`. What does this object contain? Type `print(x)` into the console and press enter again. Your console should now contain the following output:

```{r testrstudio}
x <- 5 + 2
print(x)
```


## Updating R and RStudio

* If you already installed R or RStudio for a previous course or research, update both to the most current version. Generally this entails downloading and installing the most recent version of both programs. When you update R, you don't actually remove the old version - you simply have both versions on your computer and default to the most recent version. Sometimes this is useful when specific R libraries require an older version of R, however we will generally stick to the most recent versions of R and RStudio.
* When you update R, make sure to update your libraries as well. The following command should perform most of this work (note you may have to manually update certain libraries such as those installed directly via Github).

```{r update, eval=FALSE}
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)
```

## Add-on libraries

We will frequently use libraries in R that are not part of the base distribution. To install additional libraries that have been submitted to the CRAN repository, we use the `install.packages` function in R.^["Package" and "library" are two terms many programmers use synonymously. While there are technically differences between the two terms, we will use them interchangably in this course.] For instance, one library we will use extensively in this course is [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html), a package for data manipulation. To install `dplyr`, run the following command:

```{r install_dplyr, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
```

If you run into errors later in the course about a function or package not being found, run the `install.packages` function to make sure the package is actually installed. For example, I might want to use the [`broom`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom/index.html) package by David Robinson to tidy the results of my statistical analysis. What happens if I try to use the library without installing it?

```{r rm_broom, include=FALSE}
try(remove.packages("broom"))
```

```{r broom_error, error=TRUE}
library(broom)
```

Okay then, let's install it (`repos` tells R from which CRAN server we want to download the package - generally you will not need to specify this when you install packages).

```{r install_broom}
install.packages("broom", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
library(broom)
```
