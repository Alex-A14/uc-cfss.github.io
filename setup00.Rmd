# R

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source programming language based on the [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)) from the 1970s. It is very popular in the physical and social sciences due to it's cost (free) and versatility. Thousands of expansion libraries have been published which extend the tasks R can perform, and users can write their own custom functions and/or libraries to perform specific operations.

## Installing R

1. Download the latest binary distribution for your operating system (e.g. Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux) from [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/). The binary version has been pre-compiled and is the easiest to install. Windows users should make sure to select the binary for the *base distribution*.^[Advanced users may want to install from source, but most likely if you are an advanced user you don't need to take this course.]
2. Run the installation from the file you just downloaded (`.exe` or `.pkg`).
3. Open R. You should see a screen similar to this:

This is the default R console. You can use this as your development environment where you write and execute code. However the default R console is very minimalistic and not much more useful than a text editor. This is why we will use RStudio for programming in R. However to demonstrate that your R installation works, type `5 + 2` in the console and press enter. You should see the following:

```{r}
5 + 2
```

Congratulations! You just programatically performed basic arithmetic.
