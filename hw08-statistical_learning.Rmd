# Overview

Due before class Wednesday November 23rd.

# Fork the `hw08` repository

Go [here](https://github.com/uc-cfss/hw08) to fork the repo for homework 08.

# Your mission

Implement a statistical learning model. Use cross validation to assess the robustness of your findings.

# Submit the assignment

Your assignment should be submitted as a set of R scripts, R Markdown documents, Jupyter Notebooks, data files, etc. Whatever is necessary to show your code and present your results. Follow instructions on [homework workflow](hw00_homework_guidelines.html#homework_workflow). As part of the pull request, you're encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc.

# Rubric

Check minus: Cannot get code to run or is poorly documented. Severe misinterpretations of the results. No effort is made to pre-process the text for analysis.^[Or you provide no justification for keeping content such as numbers, stop words, etc.]

Check: Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). Nothing spectacular, either bad or good.

Check plus: Interpretation is clear and in-depth. Accurately interprets the results, with appropriate caveats for what the technique can and cannot do. Code is reproducible (i.e. if analyzing tweets, you have stored a copy in a local file so I can exactly reproduce your results as well as run it on a new sample of tweets). Uses a sentiment analysis or topic model approach not directly covered in class.
