# Overview

Due before class Monday October 10th.

Now that you've demonstrated your software is setup, the goal of this assignment is to practice wrangling and exploring data.

# Fork the `hw02` repository

Go [here](https://github.com/uc-cfss/hw02) to fork the repo for homework 01.

# Part 1: Exploring clean data

[FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), a data journalism site devoted to politics, sports, science, economics, and culture, recently published a series of articles on [gun deaths in America](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths-introduction/). Gun violence in the United States is a significant political issue, and while reducing gun deaths is a noble goal, we must first understand the causes and patterns in gun violence in order to craft appropriate policies. As part of the project, FiveThirtyEight collected data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as other governmental agencies and non-profits, on all gun deaths in the United States from 2012-2014.

## Obtain the data

I have included this dataset in the [`rcfss`](https://github.com/uc-cfss/rcfss) library on GitHub. To install the package, use the command `devtools::install_github("uc-cfss/rcfss")` in R. If you don't already have the `devtools` library installed, you will get an error. Go back and install this first using `install.packages()`, then install `rcfss`. The gun deaths dataset can be loaded using `data("gun_deaths")`. Use the help function in R to get detailed information on the variables and coding information.

## Explore the data

Using your knowledge of `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, use summary statistics and graphs to answer the following questions:

### Basic questions

1. In what month do the most gun deaths occur?
1. What is the most common intent in gun deaths? Do most people killed by guns die in suicides, homicides, or accidental shootings?
1. What is the average age of females killed by guns?
1. How many white males with at least a high school education were killed by guns in 2012?
1. Which season of the year has the most gun deaths? Assume that
    * Winter = January-March
    * Spring = April-June
    * Summer = July-September
    * Fall = October-December

### In-depth exploration

1. What is the relationship between race and intent? For example, are whites who are killed by guns more likely to die because of suicide or homicide? How does this compare to blacks and hispanics?
1. Are police-involved gun deaths significantly different from other gun deaths? Assess the relationship between police involvement and age, police involvement and race, and the intersection of all three variables.
1. Identify a question of interest that can be answered using this data and answer it using graphs and summary statistics.

# Part 2: Wrangling and exploring messy data

The [Supreme Court Database](http://scdb.wustl.edu/) contains detailed information of decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. It is perhaps the most utilized database in the study of judicial politics. Until recently, the database only contained records on cases from the "modern" era (1946-present). Recently the database was extended backwards to include all decisions since the formation of the Court in 1791. While still in beta form, this extension opens the doors to new studies of the Court's pre-modern era decisions.

In the `hw02` repository, you will find two data files: `SCDB_Legacy_03_justiceCentered_Citation.csv` and `SCDB_2016_01_justiceCentered_Citation.csv`. These are the exact same files you would obtain if you downloaded them from the original website; I have included them in the repository merely for your convenience. Documentation for the datasets can be found [here](http://scdb.wustl.edu/documentation.php). The data is structured in a semi-tidy fashion. That is, every row is a vote by one justice on one case for every case decided from the 1791-2015 terms.^[Terms run from October through June, so the 2015 term contains cases decided from October 2015 - June 2016] Variables you will want to familiarize yourself with include: term, caseIssuesId, justice, justiceName, decisionDirection, majVotes, minVotes, majority, majOpinWriter, majOpinAssigner, and chief.

In order to analyze the Supreme Court data, you will need to import these two files and join them together (see `dplyr::bind_rows()`).^[Friendly warning: you will initially encounter an error attempting to join the `tibbles`. Use your powers of deduction (and Google/Stack Overflow/classmates/me and the TA) to figure out how to fix this error.]

Once joined, use your data wrangling and exploratory data analysis skills to answer the following questions:

1. What percentage of cases in each term are decided by a one-vote margin (i.e. 5-4, 4-3, etc.)
2. In each term he served on the Court, in what percentage of cases was Justice Antonin Scalia in the majority?
3. In each term he served on the Court, in what percentage of cases was Justice Scalia in the majority? Compare the percentage for all cases versus non-unanimous cases (i.e. there was at least one dissenting vote)
4. In non-unanimous decisions, how frequently did the senior justice in the majority assign the majority opinion to Justice Scalia?^[Note that regardless of the number of years served on the Court, the Chief Justice of the United States is always the senior justice whenever he votes with the majority.]
5. In each term, what percentage of cases were decided in the conservative direction? How did the Chief Justice influence these trends?

# Submit the assignment

Your assignment should be submitted as two RMarkdown documents. Follow instructions on [homework workflow](hw00_homework_guidelines.html#homework_workflow). As part of the pull request, you're encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc.

# Rubric

Check minus: `README.md` says equivalent of "This is the repository of Benjamin Soltoff". All work done via browser at github.com ... but that's just a guess, because student doesn't actually say how it was done.

Check: something in between

Check plus: `README.md` provides a proper introduction of student to the class. It also demonstrates experimentation with 4 or more aspects of the Markdown syntax. Examples: section headers, links, bold, italic, bullet points, image embed, etc. The student describes how they got the changes into `README.md` and offers a few reflections on their GitHub workflow and their experience with Markdown.
