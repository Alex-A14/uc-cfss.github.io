## Textbooks/Readings

### Required

* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) -- Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. Hardcover to be published late 2016, but an open-source online version is available now.
* Think Python, 2nd Edition -- Allen B. Downey. [Hardcover available on Amazon for $40](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist/dp/1491939362/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1468610678&sr=8-1&keywords=think+python), but a digital copy is available [via the UChicago library (authentication required)](http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/9781491939406?uicode=uchicago).

### Optional

* [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition](http://link.springer.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/10.1007%2F978-0-387-98141-3) -- Hadley Wickham. Excellent resource for the ggplot2 graphics library.

## Software

By Day 1, you should install the following software on your computer:

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) - easiest approach is to select [a pre-compiled binary appropriate for your operating system](https://cran.rstudio.com/).
* [RStudio's IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) - this is a powerful user interface for programming in R. You could use base R, but you would regret it.
* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) - Anaconda is a popular distribution of Python and includes many important packages already pre-loaded.
* [Github](https://github.com/) - Github is a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) which is used to manage projects and track changes in computer files. Once installed, it can be integrated into RStudio to manage your course assignments and other projects.

Instructions for downloading and setting up this software can be found [here](setup00.html).

## Evaluation

### Homework assignments (50%)

Each week students will complete a take-home programming assignment linked to that week's lecture materials. These assignments will be due the following week prior to Monday's class. Weekly lab sessions will be held to assist students in completing these assignments. While students are encouraged to assist one another in debugging programs and solving problems in these assignments, it is imperative students also learn how to do this for themselves. That is, *students need to understand, write, and submit their own work.*

### Final project (50%)

The final project will be an application of computational social science which incorporates concepts and methodological approachs from throughout the quarter. These projects are expected to tackle a relevant research question in the social sciences. Undergraduate students will select from a set of potential data sources and create an interactive, web-presentable product. Graduate students are expected to identify a question relevant to their own research agenda and apply a computational approach to answering it; the final product can take the form of a traditional (but computationally-based) research paper or an interactive, web-presentable product. Undergradute students may petition to complete their own "graduate" research project. Projects will be completed either individually or in a group of up to 3 students; the larger the group, the higher the expectations.
